# ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages

This walkthrough on ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA models is well-organized and covers the essential steps for time series forecasting. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key elements and suggestions on enhancing your analysis:

## Key Steps and Code Explanation
1. **Visualize the Time Series:** Import and inspect the dataset using **pandas** and visualize sales data using **matplotlib** for initial insights. Removing unnecessary rows and setting the 'months' column as the index organizes the data for time series analysis.

2. **Stationarity Check:** 
- Using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test with **statsmodels.tsa.stattools.adfuller** evaluates if the series is stationary.
- Based on the p-value, applying differencing (first difference and seasonal difference) achieves stationarity, which is vital for reliable ARIMA modeling.

3. **ACF and PACF:** 
- Auto-correlation (ACF) and Partial Auto-correlation (PACF) plots help identify suitable AR and MA orders. Here, you apply differencing, then plot ACF and PACF using **plot_acf** and **plot_pacf** to determine model parameters **p**, **d**, and **q**.

4. **Building the SARIMA Model:** You defined the SARIMA model using **SARIMAX** with both non-seasonal and seasonal components (**seasonal_order=(1, 1, 1, 12)** for monthly seasonality).
Fitting the model and printing the summary provides information on parameter estimates and diagnostics for tuning.

5. **Forecasting:** 
- After fitting, generating forecasts extends the time series data into the future. Creating a **forecast** column in the dataframe and plotting shows the prediction alongside historical data.
- Adding future dates with **DateOffset** and concatenating with **future_df** allows for extended forecasting and visualization.


## Enhancements and Next Steps
#### To make your analysis even more effective:

1. **Parameter Tuning with Grid Search:**

- Use a grid search with cross-validation for the ARIMA orders **(p, d, q)** and seasonal orders **(P, D, Q, s)**. Libraries like **pmdarima** can automate this and find the best model configuration based on AIC/BIC scores.

2. **Forecast Accuracy:**

- Calculate forecast accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to validate model performance on a test set.

3. **Exploring Model Residuals:**

- After fitting, inspect residuals to ensure they resemble white noise (no patterns or auto-correlation). This can help validate that the model captures the underlying patterns effectively.

4. **Exploring Advanced Techniques:**

- Consider other time series models (e.g., Prophet, LSTM for deep learning-based models) for complex patterns or longer-range predictions
